HGA101 is a crude GPGPUdesign, with a 5-stage RISC-V32ia core and a 16bit*8 lane integer/float SIMD pipeline. 

this is a part of the RV-AT project (https://github.com/RV-AT)

Now everything is WIP

Please bare this in mind: THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND I DO NOT PROVIDE ANY GUARANTEE

Some more info and thank will be added here after FPGAChina 2020 competetion finished, and I will keep working on this project

Now status:

Code        WIP
